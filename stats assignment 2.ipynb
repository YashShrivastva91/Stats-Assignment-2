    "Question 1: Explain the properties of the F-distribution.\n",

    "1) It is positively skewed.\n",
    "2) The values are always non-negative.\n",
    "3) It depends on two degrees of freedom: d1 (numerator) and d2 (denominator).\n",
    "4) The mean of the distribution is d2/d2−2 for d2>2.\n",

    " -- F-tests: To compare two sample variances.\n",
    "-- Regression analysis: To test the overall significance of the model (by comparing explained and unexplained variances).\n",
